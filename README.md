# GPTO-Go

Welcome to the GPTO-Go repository! This project aims to develop a service to access ChatGPT using only cellular connections, catering to environments with low cell service. Currently in its early stages, we are seeking individuals with experience in dynamically scaling systems with telephone numbers and APIs to join our efforts.

## About the Project

The primary objective of GPTO-Go is to provide access to ChatGPT even in areas with limited cell service. By leveraging cellular connections, we aim to make the power of conversational AI available in diverse settings where traditional internet access may be unreliable or unavailable.

## Seeking Collaborators

We acknowledge that while we have a foundational understanding, we require additional expertise to transform this project into a robust, real-world product. If you have experience in dynamically scaling systems, working with telephone numbers, or developing APIs, we invite you to contribute your skills and insights to this project.

## How to Get Involved

If you're interested in joining our efforts or learning more about the project, please reach out to us! You can express your interest by contacting us through GitHub.

We look forward to collaborating with you to bring GPTO-Go to fruition and make conversational AI accessible in low cell service environments. Thank you for your interest!
